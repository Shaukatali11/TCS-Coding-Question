Question:
An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the 
given data below:
1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W

The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

Example :
Input :
200  -> Value of V
540   -> Value of W

Constraints :
2<=W
W%2=0
V<W

Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.

The input format for testing 
The candidate has to write the code to accept two positive numbers separated by a new line.

First Input line - Accept value of V.
Second Input line- Accept value for W.

The output format for testing 
Written program code should generate two outputs, each separated by a single space character(see the example)
Additional messages in the output will result in the failure of test case



==================================Solution===================================================

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int V, W;
    cin >> V >> W;

    // Validate input constraints
    if (W < 2 || W % 2 != 0 || V >= W) {
        cout << "INVALID INPUT" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculate number of four-wheelers (FW)
    int FW = (W - 2 * V) / 2;
    // Calculate number of two-wheelers (TW)
    int TW = V - FW;

    // Check if the results are valid
    if (FW >= 0 && TW >= 0) {
        cout << "TW="<<TW << " " << "FW="<<FW << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "INVALID INPUT" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
